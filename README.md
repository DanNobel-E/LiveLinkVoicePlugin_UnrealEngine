# LiveLinkVoicePlugin_UnrealEngine
An Unreal 5.0.2 plugin to implement audio source capture through **Live Link Plugin**.

## Requirements 
* **Unreal LiveLink Plugin.** 

You can add the plugin to your project by going to *Edit->Plugins* menu entry, then search for "**Live Link**" and set *Enable On*. After reloading the project, go to *Window->Virtual Productuon->Live Link* to open Live Link source window.

## How to install

Download the *LiveLinkVoicePlugin* directory from this repository, then copy it inside your project's Plugins directory. Now **LiveLink Voice Plugin** will be added to the *Edit->Plugins* menu and you just need to set *Enable On* and reload the project.

## Description

**LiveLink Voice Plugin** allows you to use your *default audio input* device as a Live Link source. Record external sounds and reuse them as inputs for your *Unreal Engine* project. 
**Live Link Voice Source** exposes the following data:

* Sound *Duration*.
* Sound *Volume*.
* Sound *Pitch*.

## Example:

Let's try to implement a **LiveLink Voice Source** as a World Light Controller.

* ### Step 1: *Create LiveLink Voice Source*

On Live Link source window, click on *Add* button and select Voice Source on the menu. A LiveLink Voice Source will appear inside the window, automatically linked to the default input audio device of your platform.

* ### Step 2: *Voice Settings*

Together with the creation of the **Voice Source**, a **Voice Settings** Asset will be generated. Inside, you can set useful parameters concerning *Voice Capture Rate* anch *Pitch Curve implemantation*. 

| Name | Description|
|------|------------|
| **Interpolation Mode** | *Pitch Curve* keys interpolation mode. |
| **Tangent Mode** | *Pitch Curve* keys tangent mode, used for smoothen curve trend. |
| **Volume Multiplier** | Used to amplify *Volume Curve* resulting data. |
| **Sample Rate** | Timestep between a *Pitch sample* and next one. Low values will worsen performances. |
| **Default Step Value** | The number of stored data to step during *Pitch Curve* creation. With an high Step Value *Pitch Curve* will be less accurate but smoother.  |
| **Normalize Value** | The Normalize Value for *Pitch data*, allowing you to smoothen *Pitch Curve* according to your preferences. |
| **Pitch Curve** | A float curve which will be updated with time relative *Pitch values* as the voice capture starts recording. The *Pitch Curve* will be overwritten when capturing restarts. |

* ### Step 3: *LiveLink Voice Controller*

You'll need a **LiveLink Voice Controller** in order to connect a **Voice Source** to an *Actor*. Just create your **Voice Controller** by inheriting from *LiveLinkVoiceController* blueprint. Now there's only a few more instructions to follow:

* *Open the **Voice Controller** blueprint details tab.* 
* *Bind the Controller to your **Voice Source** in "**Subject Representation**" menu entry.*
* *Connect your **Voice Settings** to the Controller using "**Source Settings**" menu entry.*

* ### Step 4: *Start Capture!*

Tha game is set. Now you can create your own *Actor*, add your **LiveLink Voice Controller** as a component and use it to access "***Start Capture***" and "***Stop Capture***" blueprint functions. Possibilities are endless!

> You can use Live Link window **LED** as a feedback for your voice Capture. --> **Waiting = Yellow / Capturing = Green**.
